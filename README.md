Final Thoughts and Reflections: 
I think this course really helped me develop my data visualization and data storytelling skills. Each chapter helped identify aspects that are important in representing data, from choosing the right kind of graph to show your data, to understanding how to edit and use leaflet maps. In addition to just learning how to use the applications, the course helped identify common mistakes that people make so then it was easy to avoid these once I was more aware. I think I definitely achieved my personal goal of being able to depict any kind of map data that I wanted using the templates provided. What I would like to learn next would be more of the coding the behind the mapping process so I could change it to exactly what I want.
